# coding-quiz

Summary:
<br>
The objective of this application is to quiz the user on their knowledge of code-related content. This quiz was developed using principles of Git, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. A final result is delivered based upon how much time is remaining after she/he completes the quiz. This result or final score is displayed in a separate high score window with their initials. All files were independently written. Please render using Chrome. (apologies as the scoring system is currently bugged at some points during the application)

<br>

Breakdown:
<br>
Upon reading the quiz's instructions and with a little mental preparation, the user can click the "Start Quiz" button. She/he is then prompted to answer three coding-related questions in a multiple choice format within a given time limit of 60 seconds. Answering correctly has no effect on remaining time/score, while answering incorrectly reduces the timer/score by 3 seconds. Once the three questions are answered or the time remaining ends the user is assigned a score, which they can attach their initials to. Their initials and score are then stored and displayed onto a high scores window. The user can repeatedly take the quiz to earn a faster time or higher score.
